# Hangman-Game

This is hangman game where the users have to guess letters of the word the computer gives them from the list. The user has 10 ties and after the 10th try the "you loses" prints out.

In the first code we can see that we imported random, which are from the listed the teacher provided. Then "guess the letters" screen will print out, and that's when the user starts typing different letters. 

Then the code is set that every time the user inputs a wrong letter, the number of tries decreases and after 0 the you loose screen shows up.

As you can see from the code there are encrypted codes that are decrypted on the lower part of the codes
